*MITRE ATT&CKÂ® is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community.*

:star: We will create a project to detect well known attacks. You can use any Red Team simulations

1. First, we will take the very first tatic on the photo above which is Initial Access. We will name the project, story, or task **"Defend and Detect: Initial Access"**
