# I. Detection Engineering: 

## [+] Scope
1. This project aims to enhance the organization's detection and response capabilities through a comprehensive approach that includes MITRE ATT&CK framework and Threat Intelligence.

2. The goal of detection engineering is to design, develop, and implement effective security solutions that can detect and respond to potential threats in a timely and efficient manner. 

## [+] Benefits
1. ***Proactive Security:*** Focuses on identifying and closing gaps in an organization's security posture. 
 
 > By creating and testing detection mechanisms, security teams can better identify and respond to security incidents before they result in a major breach.

2. ***Evaluating Enterprise Endpoint and SIEM Detection:*** to ensure they are detecting and alerting on relevant security events. 
> This includes setting up alert policies that trigger notifications when certain events occur

3. ***Effective Alert Policies:*** Helps to create more effective alert policies by identifying the most critical events that require immediate attention. 
> This helps to reduce alert fatigue and improve the efficiency of security teams in responding to security incidents.

4. ***Improve Skillsets:*** Helps the Detection Enginner or security team understand the flow of an attack. 
> Improves the function of creating queries and alert policies.

5. ***Concised and Refined Incident Response:*** Helps the security team identify threats efficently and identify them before damage can be done. 
> Help the Security Team be more proactive

# II. Automating MITRE ATT&CK Using Atomic Red Team

# III. Detect Current Attack Trends Using Threat Intelligence 

# IV. TBA
## [+] Continuous Improvement Plans (TBA - More Plans Coming Soon!)
1. **Creating automation on SOAR playbooks:** SOAR playbooks automate response actions to security incidents based on detection and incidents. Review, update, and create playbooks to respond

2. *More Coming Soon!*
> More Random Ideas: Concised Notification Automation (Teams, Slack, Emails), Threat Hunt Automations, Actual Pentest to Mimic activity of APT
